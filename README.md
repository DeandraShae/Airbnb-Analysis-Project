# **Project Overview**

**Objective:** Segment Airbnb customers based on their booking habits and preferences.

**Goal:** Develop targeted marketing strategies for each segment to enhance booking rates and customer satisfaction.

**Repository:** [Github â€” Airbnb Analysis Project](http://github.com/DeandraShae/Airbnb-Analysis-Project)

# **Reasoning for Project Choice:**

This was my first portfolio project, chosen to delve into real-world data and apply data analysis techniques to extract actionable insights. As I am leaning towards product analyst tasks, the Airbnb dataset provides a rich source of information that allows for a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior and preferences. By working on this project, I aimed to:

- **Develop Practical Skills:** Enhance my skills in data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Apply Advanced Techniques:** Use statistical and machine learning techniques to derive meaningful conclusions.

# **Takeaways from the Project:**

I would have liked to delve deeper into constructing more models and performing more feature engineering. I will focus on these aspects in future projects and use Tableau for visualizations.
